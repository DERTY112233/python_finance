# python_finance
this is just me making python scripts to make finance easier


# Finance.py:
This is to calculate the monthly and/or anual interest rates in the context of your savings account

# Taxes.py:
This is to calculate the amount of taxes due at the end of the year, you would need to change accordingly as this is the SARS rates for the year 2024

More coming soon
